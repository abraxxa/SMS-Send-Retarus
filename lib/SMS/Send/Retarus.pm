    use SMS::Send;
    use Try::Tiny;
    my $sender = SMS::Send->new('Retarus',
        _login    => 'foo',
        _password => 'bar',
    );

    try {
        # $sent is always true because we throw exceptions on all failures
        my $sent = $sender->send_sms(
            to      => '+43123123456789',
            text    => 'This is a test message',

            }
        );

        # if you still want to conform to the SMS::Send::Driver API for the
        # case you change the driver
        if ( $sent ) {
            # $sent is a hashref containing everything the API returns
            print "Message sent ok: " . $sent->{jobId} . "\n";
        } else {
            # this API doesn't allow to know the reason of the failure
            # which is why this driver always throws exceptions as objects
            print "Failed to send message\n";
        }
    }
    catch {
        # $_ is a SMS::Send::Retarus::Exception object that stringifies to the
        # error message

    };

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module currently uses the JSON REST API according to the Retarus
documentation from the 23rd March 2016.

=head1 METHODS

=cut

sub new {
    my $class = shift;
    my $self = { @_ };

    $self->{$_}
        or croak "$_ missing"
            for qw( _login _password );

    return bless $self, $class;
}

=head2 send_sms

Is called by L<SMS::Send/send_sms> and passes all arguments starting with an
underscore to the request having the first underscore removed as shown in the
SYNOPSIS above.
The list of supported options can be found in the Retarus SMS for Applications
documentation which sadly isn't publicly available.

Returns true if the message was successfully sent.

Throws a L</SMS::Send::Retarus::Exception> object if any error like a timeout
in the underlying connection occurred or the API didn't respond with a success
http status code.

        try { ( response => decode_json( $response->{content} ) ) },

}

=head1 SMS::Send::Retarus::Exception

All exceptions thrown are SMS::Send::Retarus::Exception objects subclassed
from L<Exception::Class>.
They stringify to the error message, which is also returned by the I<error>
and I<message> methods.
The other methods are I<response>, which contains the API response if it was
decodeable, and I<status> which is the status code of the HTTP response.
